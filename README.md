# Conti_Leak_Translated
This translated pdf contains the full conversation between Conti Ransomware Gang members posted to vs-underground share. This was translated Russian-English so expect some of the content to be miss-translated e.g. a hash was provided calling it a 'cat'

The image below is a screenshot of the original re-tweet by Dave Kenedy pointing out the find which was pulled and translated early morning 2/28/2022
